## IU Research Submissions for Roger Temam Spring 2022-Spring 2024 Portfolio

Between the Spring 2022 and Spring 2024 semester, I have worked on various reports overlapping in topics in analysis that include measure theory, stochastic partial differential equations, measure theory, and functional analysis.

In a future draft of this portfolio webpage, I'd love to explain in more detail some of the big research questions (and essentially my future dissertation topic) that I seek to solve. But since there is a big time crunch to roll out this portfolio, I will for now briefly summarize two of these research questions:

**Question 1.** First involves the Skorohod Theorem. For those who don't know Probability Theory very well, Skorohod's Theorem is an important theorem in probability stating that for every sequence of probability measures in a Borel measure space generated by cauchy complete metric that (weakly) converge, there exists a sequence of random variables with distributions equal to the probability measure such that they converge pointwise.

The original goal, which I was trying to do for my first "original result" topic, was to figure out a "more efficient" or "more intuitive" proof. It is my belief that I have stumbled upon a framework that may not achieve the former (since the current draft exceeds 40 pages!), but more or less achieves the latter, since the framework of the proof is through construction of a probability tree (a pretty accessible tool in mathematics) that models the behavior of the distribution, in a way that insures pointwise convergence of the distribution. While this foundational concept is pretty intuitive, getting this idea from working in special cases where the sequences of random variables behave in topologically nice ways to the general case has proven to be a challenge that I more or less have completed, but there are details still in need of being ironed out.

In looking over my reports, which I was working with Dr. Temam on before his sudden retirement as of Spring 2025, you will see the overall rather bumpy road of a journey I have gone down to eventually get to my most recent 44 page draft.

**Question 2.** Next involves what I view to be my primary research interest that deals with what is called Random Measures, which have two (equivalent) definitions. The first, which is more common, is a product function of a probability space and a measusurable space (mapping to potentially any vector-valued space) that in the left slice (i.e. the outcome value of the probability space left constant) is a measure and in the right slice (i.e. the value of the measurable space left constant) a (potentially vector-valued) random variable. The next, which is less common though I also have seen it in literature, is a (technically deterministic) measure that maps from the given measurable space to the space of random variables, which may not be a banach space, however it is cauchy-complete semi-quasi norm where measure theory may be "clunky" due to such topological vector spaces not behaving as nicely as banach spaces, but still there is some measure theory that can be done that is worth looking at.

The overall goal of is to do what I haven't seen the literature that I've looked at related to this topic do, which is to build up a measure-theoretic framework for stochastic calculus, by proving that results such as the Convergence Theorems (which turn out to be fairly straightforward, though a bit tedious in the way I've proved it in my latest report so far), Caratheodory Extension, and in the real-valued random measure settings the Jordan Decomposition and Radon Nikodym Theorems (which turn out to be less straightforward results). It is my belief, and something I want to show for my dissertation topic, that such measure theoretic results in stochastic calculus can be further established by analyzing random measures as vector-valued measures, which simplify in the sense of becoming deterministic though open up questions as to how effective measure theory can be in such a lesser known functional analytic setting.

Though going this route is so abstract that doing a dissertation topic on this will probably only establish the framework and establish only the basic measure theoretic properties that can be applied to stochastic calculus, it is still worth exploring with the possibility in mind that perhaps some open problems in stochastic partial differential equations (ones similar to what I learned in Dr. Temam's courses on stochastic processes) can be solved by looking at the equations from the perspective of random differentials and applying the these various measure theoretic properties discovered about random measure, in ways analogous to the deterministic cases, to solve such diffy-q's.
